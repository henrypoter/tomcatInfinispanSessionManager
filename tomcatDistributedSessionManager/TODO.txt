* Does recycle work correctly? - the cache reference remains in the session, this works fine only if session could be reused in one war application, otherwise 
it is not valid!

* jmeter tests add/remove/update session attribute and than check

* create new distributed cache to store session metadata - last activity, max timeout ....

* session listeners - how to implement? write to metadata cache and broadcast through ispn listeners?

* reuse one CacheManager - fix classloaders issue

* is it necessary to lock before update session? Currently used FineGrainedAtomicMap to store session attributes
