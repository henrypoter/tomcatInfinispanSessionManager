test application to verify functionality of infinispan distributed tomcat cache manager

functionality:
* track requests and store which node was used during request
  - to test non-sticky sessions
  - to test recovery sessions

request logs contains timestamp, host ( clusterNode) name and ip address and remote host(browser) ip address and host if available

* add new value to session
* remove value from session
* invalidate session
* compute session memory consumption per session item
    - this is useful for debugging, big session objects need more time to replicate to requested session nodes and any get/update operatin is slower too
